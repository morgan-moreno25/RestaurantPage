# Restaurant Page

This project was inspired by [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com)

# What

The goal for this project was to use JavaScript explicitly to tab through the content sections (Home, Menu, Contact) by creating individual modules that each rendered their respective section.

For each individual module, I decided to use factory functions to accomplish the goal. I made this decision in order to practice my use of factory functions. I learned about the use of a self variable to refer to the parent `this` from inside child functions.

# Technology
